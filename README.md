# Luminos - CLI Utility for Integrating Large Language Models into the Shell

## Overview

Luminos is a Command-Line Interface (CLI) utility that facilitates the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into the shell environment. By bridging the gap between traditional command-line tools and advanced language models, Luminos offers a unique and powerful way to interact with LLMs directly within the terminal.

## Features

- **Direct Filesystem Access:** Luminos provides LLMs with direct access to the filesystem, enabling tasks such as file manipulation and data processing.
- **Interactive Shell Integration:** Seamlessly integrate LLM capabilities into the command-line interface for an interactive experience.
- **Versatile Task Handling:** Perform a variety of tasks, from file operations to HTTP requests, with the assistance of LLMs.

## Installation

### Install via pip3

You can install Luminos using pip3 by running the following command:

```
pip3 install luminos
```

### Install from Git Repository

To install Luminos from the Git repository, use the following command:

```
pip3 install git+https://github.com/benbaptist/luminos
```

## Getting Started

To begin using Luminos, execute the following command in your terminal:

```
luminos
```

For working within a specific directory, provide the path like so:

```
luminos path_to_dir
```

Upon starting Luminos, an interactive shell session is initiated, allowing the LLM to interact with the directory specified. Utilize the LLM's capabilities to manage tasks, ask questions, or perform actions within the shell environment.

## Examples

Explore a few examples of how Luminos can enhance your daily tasks:

- **File Management:** Instruct the LLM to rename, move, or modify files based on specific criteria.
- **Data Analysis:** Leverage the LLM for data analysis, sorting, and summarization tasks.
- **HTTP Communication:** Conduct HTTP requests through the shell for interaction with online resources.
- **Terminal Operations:** Get assistance and guidance from the LLM for executing commands and complex operations in the shell.

## Project Background

Luminos is an AI-driven project that showcases the capabilities of AI-generated content. The tool itself was utilized to develop most of the content within this project. This demonstrates the potential of AI-driven development and the seamless integration of AI-generated content to suit user needs.
