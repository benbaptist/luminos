# Luminos - CLI Utility for Integrating LLMs into the Shell

Luminos is a powerful Command-Line Interface (CLI) utility designed to effectively bridge Large Language Models (LLMs) with your shell environment. By granting LLMs direct access to a wide range of functionalities, Luminos empowers users to leverage the intelligence of LLMs for a myriad of tasks right from their terminal. This utility does not just extend the shell's capabilities to the user but significantly enhances them by providing LLMs with direct access to the file system, HTTP requests, and more, thereby assisting users in ways previously unattainable with traditional command-line tools.

## Features

- **Direct Filesystem Access:** Luminos grants LLMs direct access to the filesystem, enabling them to perform file manipulations, data processing, and more.
- **Interactive Shell Integration:** Seamlessly integrate LLM capabilities into your command-line experience, allowing for interactive, conversational utility.
- **Versatile Task Handling:** From renaming files based on their size to making HTTP requests or filtering through data, Luminos empowers users to perform a wide range of tasks efficiently.

## Usage

To start using Luminos, run it from your terminal:

```
luminos
```

Or, to work within a specific directory:

```
luminos path_to_dir
```

Upon starting Luminos, an interactive shell session is established, granting the LLM direct access to your directory. Here, you can utilize the full capabilities of the LLM to manage tasks, ask questions, or request actions be performed within the context of your shell environment.

## Examples

Here are several practical examples of how Luminos can assist in your daily tasks:

- **File Renaming and Manipulation:** Directly instruct the LLM to rename, move, or modify files based on various criteria such as size, content, or metadata.
- **Data Analysis and Processing:** Leverage the LLM's capabilities to analyze, sort, or summarize data according to your needs.
- **HTTP Communication:** Perform HTTP requests through the shell, enabling interaction with online resources and APIs.
- **Enhanced Terminal Interactions:** Ask the LLM to execute precise commands or provide guidance on complex shell operations.

By enhancing your shell with the capabilities of LLMs, Luminos transforms how you interact with your digital environment, enriching your command-line experience with intelligence and flexibility.

## Project Overview

This project is almost entirely AI-generated and self-written using the Luminos tool itself. It was a key goal of Luminos to demonstrate the power and potential of AI-driven development by creating a tool that could autonomously evolve and adapt to user requirements. The seamless integration of AI-generated content within this project showcases the innovative capabilities that Luminos brings to the table.
